# Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is a core concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It involves creating a structured representation of the business domain, capturing its rules, processes, and relationships in a way that aligns with real-world requirements. The goal is to build a model that is both expressive and useful for solving business problems, serving as the foundation for the system's architecture and implementation.

## Aggregates

Aggregates are a key building block in DDD. An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit for the purpose of data changes. Each aggregate has a root entity, known as the Aggregate Root, which is the only member of the aggregate that outside objects are allowed to hold references to. All changes to the aggregate must go through the root, ensuring consistency and encapsulation of business rules.

Aggregates help:

- Enforce invariants and business rules within their boundaries
- Control transactional consistency
- Prevent unwanted dependencies between different parts of the domain

Examples of aggregates might include an `Order` with its `OrderItems`, or a `Customer` with its `Addresses`.

## Sagas

Sagas are a pattern for managing long-running business processes and distributed transactions. In DDD, a saga coordinates and manages a sequence of events and commands that span multiple aggregates, ensuring that the overall process completes successfully or is compensated in case of failure.

Sagas:

- Orchestrate workflows that involve multiple aggregates
- Handle eventual consistency across aggregate boundaries
- React to domain events and issue commands to aggregates
- Implement compensation logic for failed steps

A saga might represent a process such as order fulfillment, which involves reserving inventory, processing payment, and arranging shipmentâ€”each step potentially involving different aggregates.

## Relationship Between Aggregates and Sagas

Aggregates encapsulate business rules and consistency within a single transactional boundary. Sagas, on the other hand, coordinate processes that span multiple aggregates, ensuring that complex business workflows are executed reliably. While aggregates focus on consistency and encapsulation, sagas focus on orchestration and process management.

In summary, domain modeling in DDD leverages aggregates to maintain consistency and encapsulate business logic, while sagas manage workflows and distributed transactions across aggregates, enabling robust and scalable business processes.
